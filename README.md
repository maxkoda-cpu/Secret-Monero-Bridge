We will be releasing v0.0.1 on the testnet very soon for more rigorous testing and for community evaluation.
We are excited about this release and look forward to community feedback.
We developed v0.0.1 privately within the development team and plan to open source the code here once we deploy the mainnet release.
We are on an aggressive development schedule to deploy the mainnet release.
