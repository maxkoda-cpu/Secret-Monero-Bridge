**This is preliminary information subject to change...**

The Secret Monero Bridge will charge nominal fees (set through governance) to:
* fund future development
* maintain operations
* reward multi-signature consensus nodes

Value enters the Secret Monero Bridge in the form of Monero (XMR) and the XMR is locked in the Secret Monero Bridge Monero multi-signature wallet,
 with the corresponding amount (XMR received - bridge fee) of sXMR (secret token) deposited into user Secret wallets. The sXMR recived can then be used
 on the Secret Network. 
 
 When XMR leaves the Secret Network through the Secret Monero Bridge, the sXMR tokens are burned, and XMR is sent to the provided Monero wallet address. There is
 a bridge fee, as well as the Monero transaction (miner) fee charged.
 
 The bridge fees are manifest as sXMR tokens. The amount of sXMR in circulation on the Secret Network consists of all the user sXMR
 tokens in addition to the sXMR collected as bridge fees.
 
 The amount of all sXMR in circulation on the Secret Network will balance with the amount of XMR locked in the Secret Monero Bridge Monero multi-signature wallet.
 
 The Monero *check_reserve_proof* will be used to prove reserves in the Secret Monero Bridge Monero multi-signature wallet.
