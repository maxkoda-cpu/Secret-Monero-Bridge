This folder contains the Proof-of-Concept (PoC) for the Secret Monero Bridge.
The PoC is a prototype provided as a simple reference model for the project's further development.

To keep things simple, the PoC doesn't implement multi-signature. The actual project deliverables will use multi-signature for security purposes.

The PoC will use the Monero and Secret Network testnets for transfer of value.
