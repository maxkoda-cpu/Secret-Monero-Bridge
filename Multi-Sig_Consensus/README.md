This folder contains Multi-Signature Consensus mechanism information.

A multi-signature consensus mechanism will be constructed to securely manage XMR transfers out of the Secret Monero Bridge Monero wallet.
At the present time we are envisioning multiple nodes residing on the network that listen for sXMR transfer events, and respond appropriately utilizing a multi-signature workflow to transfer XMR from the Secret Monero Bridge to user wallets.

Specific details regarding the Secret Monero Bridge - Multi-Signature Consensus will be found here in this folder as the project develops.
